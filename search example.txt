    ### Example Workflows:
    
    **Example 1: Simple Query**
    - Input: `Ca_00001, Ca_00002`
    - ID Type: Transcript ID
    - Operation: Sequence Data
    - Click "Add Search Query" then "Execute"
    
    **Example 2: Union of Two Searches**
    - Query A: `Ca_00001` with GO-KEGG Analysis
    - Query B: `Ca_00002` with PPI
    - Combine: A âˆª B with Sequence Data
    - This will show sequence data for both genes
    
    **Example 3: Intersection**
    - Query A: Multiple IDs with high FPKM in specific tissue
    - Query B: Multiple IDs from GO term search
    - Combine: A âˆ© B to find common genes
    - Execute any operation on the intersection
    
    **Example 4: BLAST Analysis**
    - Input: `Ca_00001, Ca_00002, Ca_00003`
    - Operation: BLAST
    - Execute to run NCBI BLAST on all CDS sequences
    
    **Example 5: Gene Structure + Primer Design Workflow**
    - Query A: `Ca_00001` with Gene Structure (GSDS)
    - Query B: Same gene with Primer Design (Cloning)
    - View both gene structure and design primers
    
    **Example 6: Chain Operations (Multi-level)**
    - Query A: 10 genes from Tissue A (FPKM > 100)
    - Query B: 8 genes from Tissue B (FPKM > 100)
    - Combine: A âˆª B â†’ Save as Query C (15 unique genes)
    - Query D: 12 genes from GO term "stress response"
    - Combine: C âˆ© D â†’ Save as Query E (common genes)
    - Execute any operation on Query E
    - âœ¨ Continue chaining as much as needed!
    
    ### Available Operations:
    
    **Data Analysis:**
    - Sequence Data, Biochemical Properties, GO-KEGG Analysis
    - FPKM Matrix, Cellular Localization, Protein-Protein Interaction
    - SNP Calling, Transcription Factor, Orthologs/Paralogs
    
    **Molecular Tools:**
    - **BLAST**: Run NCBI BLAST on CDS sequences (uses external API)
    - **Gene Structure (GSDS)**: Visualize intron-exon organization (uses external API)
    - **Primer Design (Cloning)**: Design primers for gene cloning (Primer3Plus)
    - **Primer Design (qRT-PCR)**: Design primers for expression analysis (NCBI Primer-BLAST)
    - **CRISPR Design**: Design CRISPR constructs (CHOPCHOP)
    
    ### Set Operations:
    - **Union (A âˆª B)**: All genes from both queries
    - **Intersection (A âˆ© B)**: Only genes common to both
    - **Difference (A - B)**: Genes in A but not in B
    - **Difference (B - A)**: Genes in B but not in A
    - **Symmetric Difference (A â–³ B)**: Genes in either A or B, but not both
    
    ### Tips:
    - ðŸ”— **Chain Operations**: After combining queries, click "Save as New Query" to save the result for further operations
    - ðŸ“Š **Track Origins**: Queries created from set operations show a ðŸ”— icon and display their source
    - ðŸ”„ **Infinite Chaining**: You can combine saved queries with new ones repeatedly (AâˆªBâ†’C, Câˆ©Dâ†’E, etc.)
    - ðŸ“ˆ **Build Complex Workflows**: Use multiple levels of set operations to narrow down gene lists
    - ðŸ’¾ **Clear Results**: Use "Clear Result" button to dismiss combined results without saving
    - ðŸŽ¯ **Strategic Approach**: Plan your query sequence - start broad, then narrow down with intersections
    - Use different operations on the same set of genes to get comprehensive information
    - Combine results from different analyses to find interesting gene patterns
    - **Note**: BLAST, GSDS, and Primer Design operations require external API calls and may take time
    - For Primer Design (Cloning) and CRISPR Design, copy sequences and paste into embedded tools
